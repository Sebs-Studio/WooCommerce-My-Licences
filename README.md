## WooCommerce My Licences

> ### Required to Work
> This plugin requires the use of [WooCommerce Software Add-on](http://www.woothemes.com/products/software-add-on/)

WooCommerce My Licences is a simple shortcode plugin that allows you to display the end-users licence keys in a table.

With WooCommerce Software Add-on, each software product the customer has purchased, a licence key is given but only via email when the order is completed. You also don't have the option to deactivate your licence key. With this plugin, not only does the customer see all licence keys purchased but also lists which site or instant the licence has be activated on.

To use this shortcode, simply place the shortcode on page and any software your customers have purchased will have access to the licence keys once logged in.

### Features
 * Table listing all product licence keys. [ Product Name | Licence Key | Software Version | Activations | Licence Type (Optional, requires custom setup to your personal needs) ]
 * Each licence key will list activated sites or instants along with a deactivation button
 * See how many activations the licence key has left.
